# Progressive Web App checklist

In short **Progessive Web App is not more than a set of rules**. If you pass this checklist
you can call your app/site a Progessive Web App. It says a lot of what, very little about how.

* Site is served over HTTPS
* Pages are responsive on tablets & mobile devices
* **All app URLs load while offline**
* **Metadata provided for Add to Home screen**
* **First load fast even on 3G**
* Site works cross-browser
* **Page transitions don't feel like they block on the network**
* Each page has a URL

Most are boring, some are **exiting**.
